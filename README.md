# Torgo
Torgo is a set UNIX and Plan9-like command line tools. Target platforms are Windows, Plan 9, Linux, and possibly OSX. The project's technical goal is to provide command line utilities that are accessible, homogeneous, and interoperable with each other. Non-goals are compatibility with the existing syntax and semantics of similar toolkits, such as GNU coreutils.

# Warning
Use this pre-alpha toolkit at your own risk. Many of the tools will do not work the way you expect them to on Linux.
